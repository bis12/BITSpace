      <p>
      Welcome to BITSpace, a canvas based game with educational AI based play.  
      The objective of the game is for your fleet to be the last remaining 
      fleet at the end of a battle.
      </p>
      <p>
      You build a fleet over time by designing ships with different sensors,
      weapons, and armor.  You can upgrade ships and equipment with points 
      you earn by participating in battles.  
      </p>
      <p>
      The interesting part is that <b>you do not interact with the battles in any way</b>.
      You create your own AI to control each ship based on input from the sensors you've 
      attached.  In addition, you create a commander AI that sets a general strategy for
      your force. Click below to try it out.
